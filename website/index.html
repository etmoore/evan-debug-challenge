        <h2>Developer</h2>
        <p>
          In March 2014, I quit my job to chase my dream of becoming a developer.
          Since then, I completed a three month web development course at Front
          Range Community College, interned at Digital Globe as a front-end
          developer, and graduated from gSchool a full-stack Ruby and Javascript
          developer. I am now an instructor in Galvanize's Full Stack program
          and couldn't be more excited to help others discover the joy of
          web development.

        <h2>Entrepreneur</h2>
        <p>
          Between Oct '12 and Jan '14, I founded and ran a startup called
          <a href="http://teachermaps.com">TeacherMaps</a>, a web application
          (built in Rails) that allows teachers to create, organize, and share
          instructional materials with other educators around the country. My
          two co-founders and I achieved the following before amicably parting
          ways:
          <a href="http://www.xconomy.com/boulder-denver/2013/04/18/algae-harvesters-online-market-for-teachers-share-cu-biz-plan-title/">First Place, CU New Venture Challenge</a>;
          First Place, Startup Weekend EDU; Semi-finalist, Penn Graduate School
          of Education Business Plan Competition. This experience taught me a lot
          about myself and is what ultimately convinced me to quit my job to
          become a developer.

        <h2>Educator</h2>
        <p>
          After college, I spent 3 incredibly rewarding years teaching
          middle school science as a Teach For America corps member. In 2012 I
          left the classroom and moved to Colorado with my wife where I spent the
          first summer working on school finance policy (Amendment 66) with State Senator Mike
          Johnston. I then spent a year and a half (Sept '12 - March '14) as the
          Assistant Director and later Director of Education Services at Voqal
          where I advised the governing board on education strategy and helped to
          kickstart the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOfse2ncvffeelTrqvhrz8H">Crash Course US Government Youtube Series</a>.
          Through these experiences I developed a passion for education,
          particularly edtech and the art of instruction.
